Inheritance
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class.
Single inheritance involves a class extending only one other class. It is the simplest form of inheritance that represents a straightforward is-a relationship.
Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple classes inherited from a single parent class
Multilevel inheritance involves a class inheriting from a class, which in turn inherits from another class. This forms a chain of inheritance.
